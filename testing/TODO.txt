interaction setup modular/separate function (with textList)
disp.numberOfActivations !=
could combine sounds.py with speechInOut.py
interactionQuestion could be rewritten without loop

make ID more reliable
maybe decay rate of tracking too long (dependent on fps)
(only want to count people coming from one side so long decay is fine)

passed threadevent to Speech object. maybe pass to speech_in thread
attempt hist eq on different channels (S in HSV, Cr in YCrCb)

when multiple people enter, is one being swallowed by another and then found again?
threshold for when a detected face is close enough to a face in list
are people counted twice inside the revolving door? test med andre
even slower decay to prevent double when overlapping
height of detection windows
clean up wires to make it more accessible 


Done:
histogram equalization to adjust for brightness (better/worse)
possibly stack windows vertically
track window: % of res, set 1 or 2 windows
set up face tracking window, method of selecting
set up server/client

own files: calculateEyes, sounds, soundsInOut, logging
